**Ignore file permission changes:**

```shell
git config core.filemode false
```

**Merge multiple commits as one:**

- Put the to-be-squashed commits on a working branch(eg: `temp-branch`), if they aren't already
- Check out the target branch (e.g. `master`)

```shell
git checkout master
git merge --squash temp-branch
git commit
```
<br>

**Find differences/changes:**
- `git diff --staged` - View Staged changes before commit
- `git diff origin/main..<localBranchName>` - between remote and local branches
- `git diff <oldCommit>..<newCommit>` - between two commits
- `git diff -w <fileName>` - Ignore whitespace differences
- `git diff --stat` - Lists total number of changes by file
- `git diff --numstat` - Lists additions and deletions by file
- `git diff --shortstat` - Lists total number of additions and deletions
